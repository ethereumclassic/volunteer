# Volunteering

Ethereum Classic development is actively underway by a decentralized community of volunteers. It is an open source project, where people are judged solely on the quality of their contributions.

Are you interested in volunteering your time to help the development of Ethereum Classic? Post in the issues section, tell us about yourself and we will try to help you find a place you can contribute to the Ethereum Classic project.

## Community

There are many channels of communication to interact with the ETC development community. More information can be found at https://ethereumclassic.org/community/.

## Open Standard

Volunteers are not required to know or own Ethereum Classic. If you have a good idea or well reasoned contribution, then that is all that matters. If you are capable of solving a problem, then by all means feel free to contribute!

### Protect Your Account

Take _reasonable_ security measures to ensure your account is protected by enabling 2FA on your Github account. 

https://github.com/settings/security

### Signing Your Work

Git is not foolproof, and it is strongly encouraged for volunteers to contribute with _reasonable_ security by [signing commits](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work).

#### Volunteers' GPG Keys

Volunteers can submit their public keys here: https://github.com/ethereumclassic/volunteer/tree/master/Volunteer-Public-Keys

### Pull Requests

The most efficient way to enact changes is to create a _pull request_. Create a local fork, make the change, and submit a _pull request_.

### ECIPs

Volunteers seeking to make fundamental changes to the system, please see [Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposal](https://github.com/ethereumclassic/ECIPs/) section. As always, consult the developer community for peer review and ensure the broader community has consensus.

## Founding Principles

Ethereum Classic is founded on the principles of state immutability, decentralization, and backward compatibility.

## Projects

Many projects could use assistance regardless of experience. Contribute PRs, ask fellow volunteers how you can contribute, ask for help when you need it, and grow with the ecosystem!

**Blockchain Explorer** 

http://etherhub.io

In response to none of the existing major Ethereum blockchain explorers being open source, as a community we have decided to develop a quality open source block chain explorer. Providing an open source solution which allows for easy verification of contracts supports increased contract complexity within the ecosystem.

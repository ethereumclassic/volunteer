# Volunteering

Ethereum Classic development is actively underway by a decentralized community development initiative run by volunteers.
It is an open organization where people are judged solely on the quality of their contributions.

Are you interested in volunteering your time to help the development of Ethereum Classic? Post in the issues section, tell us about yourself and we will try to help you find a place you can contribute to Ethereum Classic development.

If you are interested in community organization, you can find more information about volunteering with other community organizers here: https://github.com/ethereumclassic

## Community

### DISCORD

## Structure

I propose that we operate our development in a similar fashion to the Angel
volunteer system found at CCC events. Existing volunteers will do their best to
help new volunteers, but there is no strict leadership hierarchy.
Instead of a chain of command, I propose that we operate on a merit system where you are judged only on your code & discussion
contributions, not your age, race, gender, sex, nationality or anything else, just on
what you contribute. You do not even need to own any Ethereum classic, if you have a good idea or a well reasoned contribution, that is all that matters.

If you see anything that needs to be fixed and you are capable, please
feel free to fix it, create a local fork, make the change and submit a pull request.
Everyone is currently working in a volunteer capacity, the fastest way to enact changes is to create pull requests.


If you would like to make fundamental changes to the system, please consult
with your peers, have them review your code, and make sure we have
consensus. If the issue is contentious we should work to include the input of the wider community.

Any donations received will be fairly distributed among active volunteers.

## Objective

Our primary priority is maintaining existing clients currently maintained by the ICO backed Ethereum Foundation with
the DAO hard fork code removed to ensure easy access to the original/classic Ethereum network. We do this by keeping
up with upstream patches for every major client and provide an alternative which does not require the user to use
a special flag to run a node on the original/classic Ethereum network. 

As more people volunteer, we can shift our focus, begin to close issues shared by both ourselves and the upstream developers.
In my opinion, we should first start with restoration and access to the original/classic Ethereum network and then focus on
security oriented updates while the growing developer community discusses and builds a roadmap for future updates to the system
and which clients and projects we should support with community development.

## Projects

A wide variety of projects need assistance, regardless of your experience, if you are interested, please feel free to volunteer!
A diversity of perspectives is important and anything you don't yet know, you can learn over time.
